## 🏗️ Technologies Used

This project is built with the following technologies:

### 🎨 Frontend
- ⚡ Vite (Development Tool)
- 📜 TypeScript (Strongly-typed JavaScript)
- ⚛️ React (Component-based UI Library)
- 🎨 Shadcn-UI (Prebuilt UI Components)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS (Utility-First CSS Framework)

### 🔗 Blockchain Integration
- 🔏 **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based contracts deployed on Ethereum or compatible blockchains
- 🌐 **Web3.js / ethers.js**: JavaScript libraries for blockchain interaction
- 🗄️ **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage for assets and metadata
- 🛠️ **Hardhat / Truffle**: Development and testing frameworks for Ethereum-based smart contracts
- 🔑 **Wallet Integration (MetaMask)**:
  - 🦊 MetaMask is a browser extension and mobile wallet for interacting with blockchain applications.
  - 📥 Users must install the MetaMask extension from [MetaMask Official Website](https://metamask.io/).
  - 🔌 Connect the application to MetaMask using Web3.js or ethers.js:
    ```js
    if (window.ethereum) {
      const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
      await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
      const signer = provider.getSigner();
    }
    ```
  - ⚙️ Ensure MetaMask is configured to the correct network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, etc.).
  - 📝 Enable transaction signing through MetaMask for interacting with smart contracts.
  - 🔄 Handle account changes dynamically by detecting MetaMask events:
    ```js
    window.ethereum.on('accountsChanged', (accounts) => {
      console.log('Account changed:', accounts[0]);
    });
    ```

### 🔙 Backend
- 🟢 Node.js (Server-side JavaScript runtime)
- 🚀 Express.js (Backend framework for handling API requests)
- 🗄️ PostgreSQL / MongoDB (Database for data storage)
- ⚡ Redis (Caching layer for performance improvement)

## 🚀 How to Deploy the Project

### 1️⃣ 🌍 Deployment on Cloud Hosting Platforms
- Use a platform like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS Amplify
- Follow their deployment guides to link your repository
- Ensure environment variables are correctly configured

### 2️⃣ ⛓️ Blockchain Deployment
- 🛠️ Compile and deploy smart contracts using Hardhat or Truffle
- 🏗️ Configure contract addresses in the frontend
- 🌐 Deploy contracts on Ethereum, Polygon, or other supported blockchains

## 🌍 Custom Domain Configuration
Currently, custom domains are not natively supported. However, you can:
- 🌐 Use Netlify or Vercel for deployment and configure a custom domain
- ⚙️ Set up DNS settings to point to the hosting provider
- 📖 Refer to the hosting provider's documentation for domain setup instructions
