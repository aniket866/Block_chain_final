# Rust WebAssembly Blockchain Integration

This directory contains the Rust code that would be compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for blockchain operations.

## Structure

In a real implementation, this would contain:

1. Rust source files
2. Cargo.toml configuration
3. Build scripts for WASM compilation
4. Generated JavaScript bindings

## Integration Process

1. Rust code is compiled to WASM using wasm-pack
2. Generated WASM bindings are imported in TypeScript/JavaScript
3. Functions are called from the web application

## Example Rust Files (Placeholders)

- `src/lib.rs` - Main library entry point
- `src/wallet.rs` - Wallet connection functionality
- `src/transaction.rs` - Transaction creation and signing
- `src/contract.rs` - Smart contract interaction

## Building

In a real implementation, you would build using:

```
wasm-pack build --target web
```

This would generate the JavaScript bindings and WASM files that would be imported in the TypeScript bridge.
